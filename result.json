Step 2: Differentiate Between App Content and Ad Content. The host app, 'Family Tree!', is a puzzle game where users complete family trees based on hints. Its interface includes character icons, family tree diagrams, and game progression screens. The advertisement, visible as a banner at the bottom of the screen, promotes a different game called 'Total Battle', featuring war-themed visuals and a 'PLAY NOW' button. The content and visual style of the banner ad are distinct from the 'Family Tree!' app. Step 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time. Step 3.1: Refine the Current Start Time. Looking backwards from 04:11, the screen at 04:10 shows the 'Completed' screen of the 'Family Tree!' app without any ad banner. At 04:11, the 'Total Battle' banner ad appears. Thus, the start time of 04:11 is accurate. Step 3.3: Refine the Current End Time. Looking forwards from 04:16, the user clicks the 'Next' button at 04:16. By 04:17, the screen transitions to the next level of the 'Family Tree!' game, and the ad banner is no longer present. Therefore, the end time of 04:16 is accurate. The ad is a non-full-screen banner ad, as it only occupies a small portion at the bottom of the screen."

The main app is 'Weapon Master', a game where users merge gun parts and play a runner-style shooting game. The advertisement is a banner at the bottom of the screen promoting 'Helicopter Escape 3D', a different game. The banner displays the game's icon and title, clearly distinguishing it from the host app's content and functionality. Step 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time. The ad starts at 01:25. Looking backwards from 01:25, the screen shows the game's main interface after dismissing an App Store pop-up at 01:24. No ad content is present before 01:25. The ad ends at 01:29.

The advertisement is a banner at the bottom of the screen promoting 'Immortal Rising 2', a different game. The content and purpose of the banner ad are clearly distinct from the host app's gameplay and UI. Step 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time. Step 3.1: Refine the Current Start Time. At 03:46, the 'Weapon Master' game's level completion screen is visible. At 03:47, the banner ad for 'Immortal Rising 2' appears at the bottom of the screen. There is no earlier ad content connected to it. Thus, the start time remains 03:47. Step 3.3: Refine the Current End Time. At 03:57, the 'Immortal Rising 2' banner ad is visible, but then a 'Do you love our game?' rating pop-up appears, completely covering the banner ad. The ad content is no longer visible. Therefore, the ad ends at 03:57. The ad is a non-full-screen banner ad."

It demonstrates a \"ball sort puzzle\" game where colored balls are dropped into test tubes to sort them. Text overlays \"PLAY GAMES EARN MONEY\" appear. As the game progresses, icons for PayPal, Amazon, and a donation charity appear, implying various reward options. A reward of \"$15.00\" is displayed. The video automatically transitions back to the home screen, then immediately re-enters the ad.\n\nThe video ad resumes, continuing to demonstrate the ball sorting game (04:50-05:01). In-game pop-ups show \"You Won: $10\" and \"You Won: $25\", increasing the displayed reward amount to \"$25.00\". Additional text overlays such as \"FREE!\", \"EASY!\", \"FUN!\", \"PLAY FREE MOBILE GAMES\", and \"EARN EASY MONEY!\" highlight the benefits of the game. The ad concludes by displaying a black screen."

Step 2: Differentiate Between App Content and Ad Content. The app is 'Video Player HD', primarily a video player that also supports music playback. Its interface includes sections for 'Videos', 'Home', 'Watch History', 'Import Videos', 'Edit Video', 'Streaming Video', 'Hidden Storage', and 'Setting', along with music tabs. The advertisement promotes a separate application named 'Music Wave'. The ad banner, located at the top of the screen, features the 'Music Wave' app icon, name, rating, and an 'INSTALL' button. This content is clearly distinct from the primary functionality and interface of the 'Video Player HD' app. The ad for 'Music Wave' is a light-themed banner at the very top, clearly labeled 'Advertisement' and promoting a different application with its own branding and call to action ('INSTALL'). This visual and functional distinction clearly separates the ad content from the host app's content. Step 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time. The current identified ad period is 00:26 to 00:38. Step 3.1: Refine the Current Start Time. (A) Looking backwards from 00:26, at 00:25, the top section of the screen displays 'Space For Ad', which is an empty placeholder, not ad content. The actual 'Music Wave' ad banner appears at 00:26. Thus, the start time of 00:26 is accurate. (B) Sanity-checking forwards from 00:26, the content immediately following is the 'Music Wave' banner, which is indeed ad content. No adjustment to the start time is needed. Step 3.2: No revision was made, so we proceed. Step 3.3: Refine the Current End Time. (A) Looking forwards from 00:38, the 'Music Wave' banner disappears and is immediately replaced by a banner stating 'Ad served by Google'. This is a feedback interface from the ad platform, indicating the conclusion of the ad content. No further ad content connected to the 'Music Wave' ad is displayed after 00:38. (B) Sanity-checking backwards from 00:38, the content immediately preceding is the 'Music Wave' banner, which is ad content. No adjustment to the end time is needed. Step 3.4: No revision was made, so the end time of 00:38 is finalized. The ad is a non-full-screen banner ad."

At 00:49, when the side menu is opened, two distinct ad banners are visible within the menu interface. One is for 'RTO Vehicle' at the top, and another for 'Private vault' at the bottom, both clearly labeled 'AD'. Step 2: Differentiate Between App Content and Ad Content. The main app is a video player, and the current interface is its side menu, offering navigation options like Home, Watch History, Import Videos, Edit Video, Streaming Video, Hidden Storage, and Setting. The advertisements are for other applications: 'RTO Vehicle' (related to vehicle information) and 'Private vault' (for securely hiding photos and videos). These advertised products are clearly distinct from the video player app's core functionality and are explicitly labeled 'AD'. Step 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time. The current identified ad period is 00:49-00:51. Step 3.1: Refine the Current Start Time. (A) Looking backwards from 00:49, at 00:48, the screen shows the main video player interface with an 'Ad served by Google' banner, which is a feedback interface, not the ad content itself. At 00:49, the side menu slides in, and the two banner ads become visible. There is no earlier ad content connected to these specific banner ads. Thus, 00:49 is the precise start time for these banner ads. Step 3.2: Iterate or Finalize. The start time remains 00:49. Step 3.3: Refine the Current End Time. (A) Looking forwards from 00:51, the user clicks on the 'Private vault' banner ad. This action immediately transitions the screen away from the side menu and the banner ads. The banner ad itself ceases to be displayed at 00:51 when it is clicked and the screen changes. The subsequent full-screen interface (starting at 00:52) is a new ad experience triggered by the click, but the banner ad itself ends at 00:51. Step 3.4: Iterate or Finalize. The end time remains 00:51. At 00:49, the ads are banner ads displayed within a side menu, not occupying the full screen. Therefore, 'full_screen' is 'false'."

At 03:48, the ad shrinks to an interstitial format, still displaying Google Chrome content. At 03:53, it transitions to a static call-to-action screen for Google Chrome. The ad concludes at 03:56 when the screen goes black and then returns to the host app's interface. Since the ad initially appears as a full-screen black screen and then a full-screen white interface, it is classified as a full-screen ad."

It features a split-screen video with a reaction video on the top and a simulation of a lemonade stand game on the bottom, where the price of lemonade is discussed. This content is entirely distinct from the dictionary app's functionality. Step 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time. The ad begins at 00:07, marked by the appearance of the split-screen video and the 'Advertisement' label, fully covering the previous app interface. The content from 00:07 to 00:14 is consistently part of this game advertisement, including the lemonade stand simulation and a pop-up related to the game's pricing. At 00:14, the ad disappears, and the Oxford Dictionary app interface is fully restored. Therefore, the start time is precisely 00:07 and the end time is precisely 00:14.

Step 2: Differentiate Between App Content and Ad Content. The host application is MSNBC, a news app displaying articles and videos related to current events and politics. The advertisement promotes 'Ozempic', a pharmaceutical product for weight loss, with text like 'Get Ozempic And Start Shedding Weight Today (Take Quiz)' and 'Ships to your door. No insurance required.', clearly marked as 'Sponsored'. The content and purpose of the news app and the pharmaceutical product ad are distinct, confirming the ad is separate from the app's native content. Step 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time. The ad is a banner at the bottom of the screen. Reviewing the video from 00:36 to 00:46, various other banner ads appear and disappear, but the Ozempic ad specifically appears at 00:46 and is a new, distinct ad, not a continuation of previous ads. Therefore, the start time of 00:46 is accurate. Examining the period from 00:50 onwards, new and different sponsored content appears at 00:51, indicating the Ozempic ad is no longer present. Thus, the end time of 00:50 is accurate as it is the last frame where the Ozempic ad is visible. The ad is consistently displayed as a banner at the bottom of the screen and never occupies the full screen."

Upon reviewing the video, a banner ad is indeed present at 01:40, confirming the ad's presence. Step 2: Differentiate Between App Content and Ad Content. The app is MSNBC, a news application displaying articles and videos related to current events and politics. The advertisement, initially appearing at 01:40, promotes health and weight loss content ('Cardiologists: How to Quickly Lose a Hanging Tummy'). At 01:42, the ad content within the same banner space changes to a different health/wellness promotion featuring Chuck Norris. The content of the ads (health/wellness) is clearly distinct from the news content of the MSNBC app, and the ads are visually separated as sponsored banners at the bottom of the screen. Step 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time. Step 3.1: Refine the Current Start Time. The current start time is 01:40. (A) Looking backwards from 01:40, the content before this timestamp is the host app's news feed. Therefore, the start time is not updated. (B) Sanity-checking forwards from 01:40, the ad is clearly visible and active. Thus, the start time remains 01:40. Step 3.2: Iterate or Finalize Start Time. No revision was made, so the start time is finalized at 01:40. Step 3.3: Refine the Current End Time. The current end time from previous thinking was 01:42. (A) Looking forwards from 01:42, the ad content changes to a Chuck Norris video ad at 01:42, but it remains in the same banner ad space at the bottom of the screen. This ad continues to be displayed as the user scrolls through the news feed until 02:00. At 02:01, the user scrolls up, and the ad banner is no longer visible on the screen, replaced by the app's main content. Therefore, the end time is extended to 02:01. (B) Sanity-check backwards is not applicable as the end time was updated in (A). Step 3.4: Iterate or Finalize End Time. The end time was revised to 02:01. The ad is a non-full-screen banner ad that appears at the bottom of the screen from 01:40 until it scrolls out of view at 02:01."

It is a banner ad at the bottom of the screen featuring Chuck Norris and labeled 'Roundhouse Provisions | Sponsored'. Step 2: Differentiate Between App Content and Ad Content. The app is MSNBC, a news application displaying articles and videos related to current events and politics. The advertisement promotes a health-related product or advice from 'Roundhouse Provisions' featuring Chuck Norris. The content and purpose of the ad are distinct from the news content of the MSNBC app, and it is clearly marked as 'Sponsored'. Step 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time. The ad appears at 01:42. Looking backwards, a different sponsored ad is present at 01:41, confirming that 01:42 is the correct start time for this specific ad. Looking forwards, the 'Chuck Norris' ad is still visible at 01:43. At 01:44, a new and different sponsored ad appears in the same banner space. Therefore, the 'Chuck Norris' ad ends at 01:43.

At 02:26, a non-full-screen banner ad for gutter guards appears at the bottom of the screen as the user scrolls through the news feed.\n\nStep 2: Differentiate Between App Content and Ad Content.\n- Analyze the App: The app is MSNBC, a news application. The user is browsing articles, primarily about politics, by scrolling through a feed.\n- Analyze the Advertisement: The ad promotes a home improvement product, gutter guards. It displays an image of a man installing them and includes the text \"Here's What Gutter Guards Should Cost You In 2024\" and is sponsored by \"HomeBuddy\".\n- Clarify the Boundary: The ad is clearly distinct from the app's news content. It is a sponsored banner for a physical product/service, located at the bottom of the news feed.\n\nStep 3: Determine the Ad's Precise Start and End Time.\n- Refine the Start Time (02:26): Looking backward from 02:26, the screen shows the app's news content. The ad first scrolls into view at 02:26. There is no preceding, connected ad segment. Therefore, the start time of 02:26 is correct.\n- Refine the End Time (02:27): Looking forward from 02:27, the ad is still visible. At 02:28, the entire screen turns white, which appears to be a loading or transition state of the app itself, and the ad is no longer visible. This transition is not part of the ad.
