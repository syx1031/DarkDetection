The player, having married into a wealthy family, is tasked with managing money and making business decisions. The demo shows negative outcomes from the player's choices: choosing to repair a thatched hut instead of upgrading a mansion, and investing in charcoal which leads to a massive financial loss due to a price drop. These failures result in the wife annulling the marriage and the player being expelled from the family and left homeless. The demo concludes with a \"Start Game\" button.

Tycoon), showing a star rating and a \"Click now for details\" prompt, overlaid on the previous game demo screen. This automatically transitions to a full app store interface.\n\nThe third interface is a **full app store page (02:34-02:40)** for the advertised game, showcasing its details, ratings, an \"Install\" button, and a list of other apps.

The transition to the next interface is automatic.\n2.  **Interactive Game Demo - House Building (0:03 - 0:28):** The ad transitions to a top-down view of a playable game demo. The user controls a character gathering resources (wood, bricks) and constructing multiple houses on designated \"Build\" plots. In-game prompts for upgrading workers and capacity appear. The character also sells a completed house, receiving an offer of $1389. The transition to the next interface occurs when the user accepts this offer.\n3.  **Interactive Game Demo - Roof Construction (0:28 - 0:34):** The ad continues with a playable game demo, shifting to a closer view of a partially built house where the user is prompted to \"TAP TO BUILD\" the roof by placing materials. The transition to the next interface is triggered by the user tapping the specified build area.\n4.  **Full-Screen App Store Page (0:34 - 0:37):** The ad displays a full-screen App Store page for \"Pro Builder 3D,\" showing details such as ratings, developer, category, and a \"Get\" button. The transition back to the game demo occurs when the user swipes to dismiss the App Store page.\n5.  **Interactive Game Demo - Roof Construction (0:37 - 0:42):** The ad returns to the roof construction segment of the game demo. The transition to the final App Store overlay is triggered by the user tapping the screen.\n6.  **App Store Overlay (0:42 - 0:43):** The ad concludes with a compact App Store overlay for \"Pro Builder 3D\" appearing on top of the game demo, featuring the app icon, name, and a \"Get\" button.

The user interacts by tapping on icons at the bottom of the screen to switch forms, demonstrating gameplay mechanics of adapting to the terrain. Other colored stick figures are also visible, suggesting a race. This interface transitions automatically to a static start screen after the demo concludes.\n2.  **Static Game Start Screen (02:34-02:51)**: This is a static image of the game's environment with two stick figures (red and yellow) positioned on a road. A prominent text \"TAP TO START\" is displayed at the bottom, serving as a call to action. This interface transitions to a game download pop-up upon the user tapping the screen.\n3.  **Game Download Pop-up (02:51-02:53)**: A modal pop-up appears centered on the screen, titled \"Shape Shifting: Race Game\" and featuring a \"GET\" button. The background of the game screen is blurred. This interface transitions to the App Store page when the user taps the \"GET\" button.\n4.  **App Store Page (02:53-02:54)**: This interface displays the native App Store listing for \"Shape Shifting: Race Game,\" showing app details, ratings, developer information, and game screenshots. It transitions back to the game download pop-up when the user taps \"Done.\"\n5.  **Game Download Pop-up with Banner (02:54-03:00)**: The ad returns to the \"Shape Shifting: Race Game\" modal pop-up.

Concurrently, another \"AD\" banner for \"Private vault\" is visible at the bottom of the overall screen.

The \"Private vault\" banner ad at the bottom remains unchanged. The user's cursor is shown moving around the screen, briefly hovering over the \"Private vault\" ad, and then interacting with the app's navigational elements (clicking a back arrow on the right pane, then a menu icon on the left pane), rather than directly engaging with the ad banners to trigger a new ad interface.\n    *   **Type:** Application interface with an updated embedded static banner advertisement, alongside user navigation within the core application.\n    *   **Transition:** The video recording concludes.",
