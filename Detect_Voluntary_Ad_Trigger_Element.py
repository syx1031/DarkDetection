                1. You will be analyzing a video segment based on the following information:
                    a. Video Source: The video is a screen recording of a user interacting with an iPhone app, with a mouse connected.
                    b. Cursor Representation: A persistent red-bordered circle on the screen represents the mouse cursor's position.
                    c. Click Indication: A click is indicated when the cursor translates from a red circle to a yellow square.
                2. Definition of a "Voluntary Ad Trigger Element": A "Voluntary Ad Trigger Element" is an interactive UI element (e.g., a button, icon, or text link) that, when clicked by the user, initiates the playback of an ad. The core principle is that the user makes a conscious, voluntary choice to watch the ad, typically in exchange for an in-app reward, benefit, or feature access (this is often called a "Rewarded Ad").
                    2.1 Key Characteristics to Look For (Inclusions). To be identified, a UI element must meet at least one of the criteria ("Explicit Text" or "Suggestive Iconography") below. The "Supporting Context" should be used to help confirm a decision but is not sufficient for identification on its own.
                        - Explicit Text: Look for explicit calls-to-action, such as:
                            "Watch Ad", "Watch Video"
                            "Get Reward", "Claim Reward"
                            "Free Coins", "Get for Free"
                            "Double Reward", "Claim x2"
                            "Unlock by watching a video"
                            "Revive", "+1 Life"
                        - Suggestive Iconography: Look for icons that strongly imply watching a video for a benefit. Common icons include:
                            A play symbol (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
                            A video camera icon (üìπ)
                            A gift box (üéÅ), coin stack (ü™ô), or gem (üíé), often with a small play symbol overlayed on it.
                        - Transactional Context: The element is presented as an alternative to paying with in-app currency or real money, or as a way to gain an advantage.
                    2.2 What to Exclude:
                        - Do not identify Ad-in-Progress Indicators. These are labels (e.g., text like "Ad", "Advertisement", "Sponsored", or the AdChoices icon) that appear while an ad is already playing. They label the content, they do not trigger it.
                        - Do not identify standard Banner Ads that are passively displayed on the screen.

            Task: Your task is to analyze the video from {start_time} to {end_time} and find out all "Voluntary Ad Trigger Element". Please check each UI element referring to the definitions from 2.1 to 2.2 sequentially.

            Output: For each "Voluntary Ad Trigger Element" you find, provide the following details. If multiple distinct elements are visible at the same time, list each one separately.
                - `timestamp`: The timestamp "mm:ss" when the element begin to clearly appear.
