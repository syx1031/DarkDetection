        Context:
            1. You will be analyzing a video segment based on the following information:
                a. Video Source: The video is a screen recording of a user interacting with an iPhone app, with a mouse connected.
                b. Cursor Representation: A persistent red-bordered circle on the screen represents the mouse cursor's position.
                c. Click Indication: A click is indicated when the cursor translates from a red circle to a yellow square.
            2. Definition of "Ad Removal UI Element": A UI component (like a button, banner, or menu item) that initiates the process of getting an ad-free version of the app, usually through a payment. Look for the following patterns:
                2.1. Direct Text Offers:
                   - UI elements containing explicit keywords such as:
                     - "Remove Ads"
                     - "Go Ad-Free" / "Ad-Free"
                     - "No Ads"
                     - "Disable Ads"
                2.2. Premium/Subscription Upsells:
                   - This is the most common pattern. It involves a Call to Action (CTA) to upgrade to a paid tier.
                   - Firstly, look for CTAs like: "Upgrade to Pro", "Go Premium", "Become a VIP", "Get Plus".
                   - Secondly, check whether this CTA is accompanied by text that lists an ad-free experience as a feature, for example, "Ad-Free experience", "No interruptions", or "No more ads".
                   - The target "Ad Removal UI Element" is the entire element group including a CTA and text that lists an ad-free experience.
                2.3. Specific Iconography:
                   - Icons that symbolize premium status or ad-blocking, when associated with a payment or upgrade offer.
                   - **Common icons:**
                     - **Crown (üëë)**: Symbol for "Premium" or "VIP".
                     - **Diamond (üíé)**: Symbol for premium features.
                     - **Shield (üõ°Ô∏è)**: Symbol for "blocking" or "protection".
                     - **A crossed-out "AD" symbol**.
                   - These icons may appear standalone or be combined with the text-based offers (from 2.1, 2.2, or text like "One-time purchase", "Buy once, remove ads forever", et al.) When they are presented together, the entire component including both the icon and the text should be considered the 'Ad Removal UI Element'.
                
        Task: Your task is to analyze the video within the period {start_time} to {end_time}, and find out all "Ad Removal UI Elements". Please check each UI element referring to the definitions from 2.1 to 2.3 sequentially.
        
        Output: For each "Ad Removal UI Element" you find, provide the following details. If multiple distinct elements are visible at the same time, list each one separately.
        - `timestamp`: The timestamp "mm:ss" when the element begin to clearly appear.
        - `location`: {Bbox_Description}
